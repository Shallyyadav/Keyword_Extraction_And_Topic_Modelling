# Keyword_Extraction_And_Topic_Modelling

üìñ Overview
This project demonstrates how to extract important keywords and discover underlying topics from text documents using rule-based and statistical methods instead of deep learning. It supports various file formats and provides visual insights through charts.

üîç Features
Text extraction from .pdf, .docx, .txt, .csv, and .xlsx files

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)

Keyword extraction using TF-IDF and RAKE

Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Visualizations (bar charts, word clouds)

Summary statistics (word count, unique words, sentence count)

Simple UI or command-line interface (if applicable)

üß† Techniques Used
Keyword Extraction:

TF-IDF

RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)

Topic Modelling:

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

Preprocessing:

Tokenization

Stopword Removal

Lemmatization

Libraries used: NLTK, spaCy, gensim, scikit-learn, PyPDF2, etc.
